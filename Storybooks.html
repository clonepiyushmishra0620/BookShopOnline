                        <p>This book is a spin-off of the famous Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, but instead of Greg Heffley, the story is told from the perspective of his best friend, Rowley Jefferson.

                            Rowley decides to write his own diary‚Äîand also a biography of Greg, whom he considers his "hero." However, through Rowley‚Äôs innocent and cheerful narration, readers often see that Greg is not always the best friend he claims to be. The contrast between how Rowley sees the world and how things really are leads to a lot of funny and heartwarming moments.</p>

                        <p>A young girl named Little Red Riding Hood is sent by her mother to deliver food to her sick grandmother, who lives in the forest. Her mother warns her not to talk to strangers.

                            On the way, she meets a sly wolf who tricks her into revealing where her grandmother lives. The wolf races ahead, eats the grandmother, and disguises himself in her clothes.
                            
                            When Little Red Riding Hood arrives, she notices that her ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äù looks strange (‚ÄúWhat big eyes you have!‚Äù). The wolf reveals himself and tries to eat her too. In most versions, a woodcutter or hunter arrives just in time to save her and her grandmother (sometimes by cutting the wolf open).</p>

                            One day, Wart meets Merlyn, a wise and quirky wizard who becomes his tutor. Merlyn teaches Wart important life lessons by transforming him into animals like a fish, a bird, and a squirrel, so he can learn about courage, leadership, and empathy.
                            
                            Later, when the King of England dies without an heir, a mysterious sword appears stuck in a stone. It is said that whoever pulls it out is the rightful king. While trying to fetch a sword for Kay, Wart casually pulls it from the stone‚Äîrevealing his destiny as King Arthur.</p>

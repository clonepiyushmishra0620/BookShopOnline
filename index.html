                            <p>After a shipwreck, a robot named Roz washes up on a remote, wild island. At first, the animals fear her, but Roz gradually learns to survive by observing nature and communicating with the creatures. When she adopts a baby gosling named Brightbill, Roz begins to form a deep bond with the island’s inhabitants and finds a sense of belonging. However, her peaceful life is threatened when robots from the factory come to take her back.

                                The book explores themes of identity, survival, family, and what it means to be alive, offering both adventure and emotional depth.</p>

                            <p>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a stage play set 19 years after the original Harry Potter series. It follows Harry Potter's son, Albus Severus, who struggles with living in his father's shadow. Albus befriends Scorpius Malfoy, and together they use a Time-Turner to try to change the past—but their actions create dangerous alternate timelines. The play explores themes of friendship, legacy, and the bond between parents and children.</p>

                            <p>The story is set in the city of Bulikov, once ruled by gods who made miracles commonplace. But after a rebellion, the gods were killed, and their miracles vanished—along with much of the city’s identity. The plot follows Shara Thivani, a brilliant spy and diplomat from the nation that overthrew the gods, who arrives in Bulikov to investigate the murder of a prominent historian.
    
                                As Shara digs deeper, she uncovers secrets suggesting the gods might not be as dead as everyone believes. With the help of her massive bodyguard, Sigrud, she faces dangerous conspiracies and divine remnants.
                                
                                The novel explores themes of colonialism, religion, memory, and power, all wrapped in a rich, mysterious world full of forgotten magic and crumbling grandeur.</p>
